/*
Question 3

Given positive two integers m and n such that m<n, the greatest common divisor of m and n is the same as the
greatest common divisor of m and (n-m). Use this fact to write a recursive definition of the function
"greatest_common_divisor(...)", which takes two positive integer arguments and returns their greatest common
divisor. Test your function in a suitable main program.
